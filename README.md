# Text-Game
This code was one of my first IT projects.<p>
When you start this appliaction with launching the main file "main.py", it will launch a RPG text game.<p>
When I wrote this code, I used OOP features that are possible for python. That's how I created classes for your hero.<p>
You control actions of your hero with numbers inserting in command line.<p>
<ul>At the beginning of the game you choose one of five classes.
<li>Warrior</li>
<li>Warlock</li>
<li>Ranger</li>
<li>Mage</li>
<li>Paladin</li>
</ul>
The storyteller accompanies you through your adventure.<p>
Your main quest is to defeat all bosses that awaits you.<p>
After every defeat, you will get a new ally that will help you to defeat your foes.<p>
Good luck and have fun, Hero!<p>
